Mission Two for Level 5 Advanced Software Developer</div>

<h3>ABOUT THE PROJECT:</h3>

This Mission is a team project, but because a lot of my team mates are advanced, they decided to do the project individually. I really struggled by myself (though Vatthana in my team did help with some things, like getting Azure AI Vision going and getting the API yeilding results in Postman) and it has made me feel like I'm really lacking and disheartened with where I'm at in this class, despite my hard work. However, I am determined to keep trying my best and attempt some projects to really understand these concepts.

In the frontend folder on this repo, you will see I have created the UI to look as close to the real Turners website as I could manage in the time given. I did spend most of the time trialing a lot of things, and almost to no avail. The Azure API is functional at a basic level on the front-end. I hope to improve it over time as I wrap my head around how to do this better.
